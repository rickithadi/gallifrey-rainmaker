# Lead Generation System Roadmap

## Current System Status âœ…
- **Competitor Discovery**: Complete - finds direct competitors like BuildPro Services, ConstructCo Melbourne  
- **Basic Web Scraping**: Built but needs testing
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Working for data export
- **Lead Processing**: Automated deduplication and scoring

## Next Phase Development ðŸš€

### 1. Site Trolling Automation
**Target Sites for Lead Discovery:**

#### Business Directories
- **Yellow Pages**: `https://www.yellowpages.com.au/search/listings?clue=construction+services&locationClue=melbourne`
- **Trusted Tradie**: `https://www.trustedtradie.com.au/construction/melbourne`
- **Hot Frog**: `https://www.hotfrog.com.au/companies/construction/victoria/melbourne`
- **True Local**: `https://www.truelocal.com.au/business/construction/vic/melbourne`

#### Industry-Specific Sites
- **Master Builders Victoria**: Member directory scraping
- **Housing Industry Association**: Builder directory
- **Commercial Real Estate**: Contractor listings
- **Australian Tenders**: Government contract databases

#### Social Media & Professional Networks
- **LinkedIn Company Search**: Automated discovery of construction companies 11-50 employees
- **Facebook Business Pages**: Local Melbourne construction services
- **Instagram Business Profiles**: #MelbourneConstruction #BuildingServices

### 2. Internet Trolling Strategy
**Search Pattern Automation:**

#### Google Search Automation
- `"construction services" Melbourne "11-50 employees"`
- `"building maintenance" Melbourne "facility management"`
- `"commercial construction" Melbourne "project management"`
- `"residential building" Melbourne "home renovation"`
- `"strata services" Melbourne "building compliance"`

#### Deep Web Discovery
- **ASIC Business Register**: New company registrations in construction
- **ABN Lookup**: Active construction businesses
- **Council Building Permits**: Recent permit applications reveal active builders
- **Tender Databases**: Companies bidding on government projects

### 3. Similar Business Finder System
**Multi-Source Discovery:**

#### Website Technology Analysis
- **BuiltWith.com**: Find websites using similar tech stacks to Strata Multi Services
- **SimilarWeb**: Competitor website discovery
- **Ahrefs**: Competing domain analysis

#### Industry Pattern Matching
- **Service Matching**: Find companies offering similar services (building maintenance, facility management, strata services)
- **Client Base Analysis**: Companies serving similar customer segments
- **Geographic Clustering**: Businesses in same suburbs/areas as successful companies

#### Revenue & Size Matching
- **Financial Database Scraping**: Companies with similar revenue ranges ($1M-$10M)
- **Employee Count Filtering**: 11-50 employee businesses
- **Growth Stage Identification**: Companies in expansion phase

### 4. Advanced Lead Discovery Features
**To Be Built:**

#### Email Discovery Automation
- **Hunter.io Integration**: Automatic email finding for discovered companies
- **Clearbit Integration**: Company data enrichment
- **Contact Role Identification**: Find decision makers (owners, project managers, operations)

#### Lead Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
const leadScore = {
  website: 0.3,        // Has professional website
  phone: 0.2,          // Valid phone number
  location: 0.2,       // Melbourne-based
  industry: 0.1,       // Construction/building
  size: 0.2           // 11-50 employees
}
```

#### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Google Alerts**: New construction companies
- **Social Media Monitoring**: New business announcements
- **News Scraping**: Company expansions, new projects
- **Job Board Analysis**: Companies hiring (indicates growth)

### 5. Google Sheets Integration Fixes ðŸ”§

#### Current Button Issues
The Google Sheets buttons aren't working because:
1. **API Endpoints Missing**: The sheet buttons try to call endpoints that don't exist
2. **CORS Issues**: Browser security blocking API calls
3. **Authentication Problems**: Service account permissions

#### Solution Implementation
```javascript
// Fix 1: Create working API endpoints
// File: pages/api/sheets/process-lead.ts
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') return res.status(405);
  
  const { leadData, sheetRow } = req.body;
  
  // Process lead through AI agents
  const classification = await classifyLead(leadData);
  const analysis = await executeAgent(classification.track, leadData);
  
  // Update sheet with results
  await updateSheetRow(sheetRow, { status: 'processed', ...analysis });
  
  res.json({ success: true, classification, analysis });
}

// Fix 2: Add CORS headers and proper authentication
// Fix 3: Create Google Apps Script for sheet-side functionality
```

#### Button Functionality To Add
- **"Process Lead"**: Classify as Enterprise/SMB and run AI analysis  
- **"Find Contacts"**: Use Hunter.io to find emails
- **"Research Company"**: Gather company intelligence  
- **"Generate Outreach"**: Create personalized messages
- **"Add to Campaign"**: Queue for automated follow-up

### 6. Automated Excel/Sheets Population System

#### Smart Data Population
```javascript
const autoPopulation = {
  companyName: "Direct from scraping",
  contactName: "LinkedIn scraping + Hunter.io",
  email: "Hunter.io API + domain guessing",
  phone: "Directory scraping + Google My Business",
  website: "Direct discovery",
  industry: "AI classification from company description", 
  companySize: "LinkedIn company page + website analysis",
  location: "Google Maps API + address parsing",
  source: "Automated tracking",
  notes: "AI-generated company insights"
}
```

#### Data Quality Assurance
- **Duplicate Detection**: Advanced fuzzy matching
- **Data Validation**: Email/phone format checking
- **Company Verification**: Website status, business registration
- **Confidence Scoring**: Lead quality assessment

### 7. Scaling & Performance

#### Batch Processing
- **Queue System**: Process leads in batches of 50-100
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful scraping delays
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates

#### Multi-Source Orchestration
```javascript
const leadSources = {
  yellowPages: { priority: 1, dailyLimit: 200 },
  trustedTradie: { priority: 2, dailyLimit: 150 },
  linkedin: { priority: 3, dailyLimit: 100 },
  googleSearch: { priority: 4, dailyLimit: 500 },
  directories: { priority: 5, dailyLimit: 300 }
}
```
